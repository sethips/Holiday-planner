# Holiday-planner
This project is a demonstration of a travel planning application using MEAN stack.

<p>This application keeps track of places you wish to travel. It uses angular and bootstrap for its front end , node and express for back end stuff and mongo db as the database.</p>
<h3>To execute</h3>

<p>1) Clone the repository and cd into it.</p>
<p>2) Run <b>npm install</b></p>
<p>3) Run <b>node app</b></p>
<p>4) Open the url <b>localhost:1234</b></p>

<h3>NOTE</h3>

<p>You don't need to set up your mongodb database url for executing this application.</p>
<p>This project is not complete of now as there are quite a few functionalities missing. I am planning to work on this later when i get some time. Meanwhile you can tweak with the code and add dome additional interactions.</p>
